# Data Slicing Project

## Overview

This project focuses on the data slicing of a main file, primarily aimed at analyzing single events within a dataset. It is designed to guide users through the initial setup and subsequent analysis of specific events, with a keen emphasis on speed calculations and their implications on data visualization.

## Getting Started

### Initial Setup

1. **CZĘŚĆ CIĘCIA GŁÓWNEGO PLIKU - PIERWSZE ODPALENIE**: Start by slicing the main file. This step is crucial for preparing your dataset for detailed analysis. Follow the instructions within the notebook to correctly slice your main data file.

### Detailed Event Analysis

2. **Event-Specific Analysis**: After the initial setup, the project shifts focus to the analysis of specific events. This involves changing parameters within the notebook to target individual events (from event_1 to event_5). It's important to note that the analysis is tailored to single impact events, and the correct file naming is critical for accurate speed calculation and visualization.

## Requirements

- Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed to run the `.ipynb` file.
- Familiarity with Python and basic data analysis libraries (e.g., pandas, matplotlib) is recommended.

## Usage

To use this project, open the `data slicing (1).ipynb` notebook in Jupyter and follow the step-by-step instructions. The notebook is structured to guide you through the process, from initial data slicing to in-depth analysis of specific events.
